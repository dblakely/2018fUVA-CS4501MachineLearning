### [The official Academic Calendar at UVA Registrar](http://www.virginia.edu/registrar/calendar.html)

### Course Basics:

+ TuTh 3:30PM - 4:45PM
+ Rice 130

### General Description:

+ Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that automatically improve their performance through experience. This 3-credit course covers introductory topics about the theory and practical algorithms for machine learning from a variety of perspectives. Topics include supervised learning, unsupervised learning and learning theory.

+ Assignments include multiple short programming and writing assignments for hands-on experiments of various learning algorithms, multiple in-class quizzes, an in-class mid-term and an in-class final exam.


### Prerequisite:

+ Required courses as prerequisite: Calculus, Basic linear algebra, Basic Probability and Basic Algorithm. Statistics is recommended.
+ Students should already have good programming skills and can program with python (required) !



### Instructor

### Course Grading Policy
  The grade will be calculated as follows:
+ Assignments (60%, with six assignments)
+ Midterm (20%): 75mins in class; closed book;  only one page of letter-size note (two-sided) is allowed; no smart device is allowed during the exam; your notes can be typed or handwritten;   
+ Final (20%): 75mins in class; closed book;  only one page of letter-size note (two-sided) is allowed; no smart device is allowed during the exam; your notes can be typed or handwritten;  
+ Extra programming tasks or Extra Sample Exam Questions (Extra 5%)
+ #### Additional Non-Linear Constraint: In order to pass the course, the average of your midterm and final must also be "pass".


### Assignment due dates, Lateness and Extensions

+ #### All communication regarding late assignment submission should be done directly with the TAs who responsible for the HW you are late for, not with the instructor.
+ Unless otherwise specified, assignments should be submitted through collab and are due  <b>
at 11:59pm on the due date </b>.
+ Programming solutions should be placed in each student's appropriate
 Collab  directory.
+ About Extensions:
  + Please submit your late assignment to 18spcs4501-ta@collab.its.virginia.edu  
  + Each student has <b>three</b> extension days to be used at his or
her own discretion throughout the entire course.
  + Your grades would be
discounted by 15% per day when you use these 3 late days.
  + You could use the 3 days in whatever combination you like. For example,
all 3 days on 1 assignment (for a maximum grade of 55%) or 1 each day
over 3 assignments (for a maximum grade of 85% on each).
  + After you've used all 3 days, you cannot get credit
for anything turned in late.


### Logistics Information
+ Announcements are being emailed to the course mailing list.
+ A welcome note will be sent to the mailing  list early in the semester.
+ If you do not receive the welcome message by Feb 1, 2018, please
send mail to the instructor.
+ Errata and answers to questions are being discussed and answered
   on  the course piazza site and through email-list.
