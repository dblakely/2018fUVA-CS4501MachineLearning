### Course Grading Policy
  The grade will be calculated as follows:
+ Assignments (60%, with six assignments)
+ Midterm (20%): 75mins in class; closed book;  only one page of letter-size note (two-sided) is allowed; no smart device is allowed during the exam; your notes can be typed or handwritten;   
+ Final (20%): 75mins in class; closed book;  only one page of letter-size note (two-sided) is allowed; no smart device is allowed during the exam; your notes can be typed or handwritten;  
+ Extra programming tasks or Extra Sample Exam Questions (Extra 5%)
+ #### Additional Non-Linear Constraint: In order to pass the course, the average of your midterm and final must also be "pass".


### Assignment due dates, Lateness and Extensions

+ #### All communication regarding late assignment submission should be done directly with   [18f-cs-4501-001-ta@collab.its.virginia.edu](mailto:18f-cs-4501-001-ta@collab.its.virginia.edu), not with the instructor.

+ Unless otherwise specified, assignments should be submitted through collab and are due  <b>
at 11:59pm on the due date </b>.
+ Programming solutions should be placed in each student's appropriate
 Collab  directory.
+ About Extensions:
  + Please submit your late assignment to 
  [18f-cs-4501-001-ta@collab.its.virginia.edu](mailto:18f-cs-4501-001-ta@collab.its.virginia.edu)
  + Each student has <b>three</b> extension days to be used at his or
her own discretion throughout the entire course.
  + Your grades would be
discounted by 15% per day when you use these 3 late days.
  + You could use the 3 days in whatever combination you like. For example,
all 3 days on 1 assignment (for a maximum grade of 55%) or 1 each day
over 3 assignments (for a maximum grade of 85% on each).
  + After you've used all 3 days, you cannot get credit
for anything turned in late.


### Logistics Information
+ Announcements are being emailed to the course mailing list.
+ A welcome note will be sent to the mailing  list early in the semester.
+ If you do not receive the welcome message the second week of the course, please
send mail to the instructor.
+ Errata and answers to questions are being discussed and answered
   on  the course piazza site and through course email-list.

### Discussion board
We will use Piazza for a discussion board. In addition to in-person assistance, this is the place where you can seek help, offer help, share your thoughts and discoveries, or discuss technical difficulties and potential troubleshooting. You can our class Piazza site through the course collab sidebar. Ask all technical questions about the course material or the assignments on Piazza.

### Academic Integrity
The School of Engineering and Applied Science relies upon and cherishes its community of trust. We firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University’s Honor principle that students will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate those who do. We recognize that even one honor infraction can destroy an exemplary reputation that has taken years to build. Acting in a manner consistent with the principles of honor will benefit every member of the community both while enrolled in the Engineering School and in the future. 


Students are expected to be familiar with the university honor code, including the section on academic fraud. Each assignment will describe allowed collaborations, and deviations from these will be considered Honor violations. If you are in doubt regarding the requirements, please consult with me before you complete any requirement of this course. Unless otherwise noted, exams and individual assignments will be considered pledged that you have neither given nor received help. (Among other things, this means that you are not allowed to describe problems on an exam to a student who has not taken it yet. You are not allowed to show exam papers to another student or view another student’s exam papers while working on an exam.) Send, receiving or otherwise copying electronic files that are part of course assignments are not allowed collaborations (except for those explicitly allowed in assignment instructions). 

Assignments or exams where honor infractions or prohibited collaborations occur will receive a zero grade for that entire assignment or exam, as well as a full letter-grade penalty on the course grade. Such infractions will also be submitted to the Honor Committee if that is appropriate. Students who have had prohibited collaborations may not be allowed to work with partners on remaining homeworks. 


### SDAC and Other Special Circumstances
The University of Virginia strives to provide accessibility to all students. If you require an accommodation to fully access this course, please contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) at 434-243-5180 or sdac@virginia.edu. If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, or to learn more about their services, you may contact the SDAC at the number above or by visiting their website at [URL](http://studenthealth.virginia.edu/student-disability-access-center/faculty-staff). 

If you have been identified as an SDAC student, please let the Center know you are taking this class. If you suspect you should be an SDAC student, please schedule an appointment with them for an evaluation. Students who need academic accommodations should see me and contact the SDAC. All academic accommodations must be arranged through the SDAC. 

If you have other special circumstances (athletics, other university-related activities, etc.) please contact instructor and/or TA as soon as you know these may affect you in class. 


### Religious Accommodations
It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements. Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing directly to me by email as far in advance as possible. Students and instructors who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the University's Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu or 434-924-3200. 

Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of the coursework missed as the result of a religious observance. 


### Statement on Violence
The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University hold as critically important:

Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.
Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.
If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and resources available - www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence. 

As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. If you would rather keep this information confidential, there are Confidential Employees you can talk to on Grounds (See http://www.virginia.edu/justreportit/confidential_resources.pdf). The worst possible situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able to help. 

### This syllabus
This syllabus is to be considered a reference document that can and will be adjusted through the course of the semester to address changing needs. This syllabus can be changed at any time without notification. It is up to the student to monitor this page for any changes. Final authority on any decision in this course rests with the professor, not with this document.
